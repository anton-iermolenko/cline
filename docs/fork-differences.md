# What AI Local changes from upstream Cline

This inventory describes the fork's current additions and behavior changes on top of Cline's coding-agent foundation. It is organized by user value, with source links and representative local commits. It is not a count of features unique to Cline or a claim that each intermediate experiment remains active.

The initial audit reviewed all 61 non-merge commits in the local `origin/main..local-main` range through `3f94d5c20`, including its integration merges. The common upstream ancestor at that audit was `f817e59f6`. Commit references below identify the local integration history; current source is authoritative.

## Model configuration and context visibility

| Change | Current implementation | Representative commits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native vLLM/HyperQwen and llama.cpp providers, discovery, native request counting, image-token accounting and serialized inference controls | [Provider guide](provider-config/local-inference.mdx), [local inference transport](../sdk/packages/llms/src/providers/local-inference.ts), [provider discovery](../sdk/packages/core/src/services/providers/local-inference-discovery.ts), [image accounting](../sdk/packages/core/src/extensions/context/image-token-accounting.ts) | `3ce9ac935`, `1620052d8`, `5cfe90701`, `430125d5a` |
| A dedicated settings screen with context/output/compaction fields, inherited versus overridden values, reasoning and sampling controls, and a full allocation breakdown | [Settings form](../apps/vscode/webview-ui/src/components/settings/providers/LocalInferenceSettingsForm.tsx), [budget calculation](../sdk/packages/shared/src/llms/local-model-budget.ts) | `e21a4880b`, `14a1db406`, `034318bd1`, `9d367c08a` |
| Default/P1/P2 slots per provider/server/model; shared editor/CLI selection; model IDs and active-slot footer labels; editable token-cost estimates per model | [Profile storage](../sdk/packages/core/src/services/storage/provider-settings-manager.ts), [CLI profile selection](../apps/cli/src/utils/local-model-profiles.ts), [cost controls](../apps/vscode/webview-ui/src/components/settings/providers/LocalModelCostSettings.tsx) | `c845dc3cd`, `d223c5b72`, `daaca2d6e` |

The budget separates tools/instructions, summary allowance, raw recent history, normal output including thinking, counting margin/boundary and iteration space. It includes the preferred compaction target, minimum iteration reserve, hard compaction cap and maximum context. The allocation display contains planning estimates; supported native counters measure the actual prepared request. Context and output limits are restored into the running session, not just displayed in settings.

## Memory, evidence and execution

| Change | Current implementation | Representative commits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Measured compaction admission and overflow recovery, independent chronological history-window notes, code/docs knowledge retention, bounded smaller retries and oldest-pair reductions | [Compaction policy](../sdk/packages/core/src/extensions/context/compaction.ts), [window summaries](../sdk/packages/core/src/extensions/context/measured-summary.ts) | `1620052d8`, `09ee22f84`, `daaca2d6e`, `7f0d1b3b8` |
| Preserve usable context across resume, missing-state recovery, checkpoint restore, repeated Undo and edited-message regeneration; stabilize prepared summarized prefixes | [Recovery](../sdk/packages/core/src/session/services/context-recovery.ts), [saved compaction](../sdk/packages/core/src/session/models/session-compaction.ts), [extension coordinator](../apps/vscode/src/sdk/sdk-compaction-coordinator.ts) | `5882da1a4`, `03eccc6d4`, `ef99d5d20`, `2eeba8380`, `71a851478` |
| Search/page acquisition provider separation; file-backed page loading, search and bounded reads; packaged page worker rather than injecting complete pages into the conversation | [Research guide](sdk/web-research.mdx), [tool implementation](../sdk/packages/core/src/extensions/tools/web-pages.ts) | `a3a58caca` |
| Native file-editor family with bounded/hash reads, exact-range edits, staged chunked drafts, guarded apply/create, and matching previews/commits | [Editor guide](sdk/native-file-editor.mdx), [engine](../sdk/packages/core/src/extensions/tools/file-editor/engine/editor.mjs), [draft protocol](../sdk/packages/core/src/extensions/tools/file-editor/engine/drafts.mjs) | `da36584de` |
| Native/headless foreground wait expiry -> same-PID background handoff with an open log; explicit foreground cancellation; continued output and exit records | [Native executor](../sdk/packages/core/src/extensions/tools/executors/bash.ts), [tool wrapper](../sdk/packages/core/src/extensions/tools/definitions.ts), [VS Code headless forwarding](../apps/vscode/src/sdk/vscode-run-commands-tool.ts) | `7f0d1b3b8`, `2763cf8ee` |
| PID identity checks, bounded log-tail process waits and validated expert-status waits; wait deadlines do not kill jobs; batched progress avoids shell polling and false loop failures | [Process wait](../sdk/packages/core/src/extensions/tools/process-wait.ts), [wait contract](../sdk/packages/core/src/runtime/safety/job-wait.ts), [runtime tracker](../sdk/packages/core/src/runtime/safety/job-wait-tracker.ts) | `ca11224d1`, `6d617933a`, `e5a866bf4`, `4d17e22d6` |
| Bounded/batched terminal reasoning previews and a proportional context meter | [Reasoning preview](../apps/cli/src/tui/utils/reasoning-preview.ts), [status bar](../apps/cli/src/tui/components/status-bar.tsx) | `c91a7a867`, `4f087acea` |

Current compaction protects the latest human instruction verbatim and summarizes older user messages normally. Map passes receive only their own window; previous notes are retained locally. Summaries are model-generated and may contain errors or conflicting historical hypotheses. Canonical history is retained for verification. Early assistant-prefill experiments, retention of every original user input, and frozen-prefix summary-reduction experiments were superseded and are not current features.

Command handoff applies to the native CLI/headless path. Visible VS Code terminal execution has its existing terminal-specific handoff. Remote PIDs require remote observation. A process wait reports liveness; disappearing from the process table does not by itself establish a successful exit.

Bootstrap rules, expert tools and notification hooks are opt-in setup material. Building the clients does not activate them, configure provider accounts, or install a user's credentials. Application/package identifiers and upstream authorship/license remain intact.

## Keep this inventory current

For a user-facing fork change, review the merged commits and final source, then update the relevant entry here. Update the root README when the public feature set or positioning changes; keep implementation details and supporting commit references here. Replace obsolete descriptions when an approach is superseded. A bug-fix commit does not automatically warrant another headline feature.
